# Overview

- **sample app** served behind a **reverse proxy**.
- The **reverse proxy** (apache) validates the authentication with a **RADIUS server**. If it succeeds, it proxies the request to the sample app 


# Getting Started

**Run it** `docker-compose up -d`

Then :
- navigate to http://localhost:8998
- Prompt to put credentials ( user = user, password = password)
- You must see the Sample App

# How it works 

## 1. Radius server : 
- define set of [users](radius-server/raddb/users): One of users is `user` and its password is `password`
- define set of [clients](radius-server/raddb/clients.conf) with secrets : 
- One of client is `everyone` ( ip = any ip , secret = bigsecret )

## 2. Redius Client - reverse proxy : 

- Released as image [abdennour/radius-auth-proxy](https://hub.docker.com/r/abdennour/radius-auth-proxy/tags)
- The redius client is the same which behaves as  the reverse proxy based on Apache.
- Request come to this reverse proxy.
- Reverse proxy prompts basic auth form
- If user is valid, reverse proxy forwads the request to the sample app.
- In the config file [radius-reverse-proxy/vhost.conf](radius-reverse-proxy/vhost.conf):
* replace `radius-server` by IP/hostname of your radius server
* replace `bigsecret` by the secret generated by radius server.
* replace `http://sample-secure-app/` by your secured app.


## .3 Sample App

Simulate a secured app in backend which is accessible only behind the reverse proxy.
